This is the source of an xml parser for D programming language.

Currently supports recent versions of D1, D1+tango, and D2.

The parser supports XML 1.1 and namespaces.

The sample applications are XmlConf.d , which can test against xml conformance test cases,
and ElementHandler.d , which registers delegate callbacks to handle element start and completion events during parse.

There is also an abbreviated xpath lookup support, and an xml based make tool called makette.

I aim to do all my builds with makette, so the shell build scripts may be neglected.

Source Directories
------------------

xmlp - xml parser, and limited xmldom and  xpath.

inrange - Read encoded strings and streams and present them as an InputRange.

xmlp -  build1.sh/.bat for D1 and D1 + tango,  buil2.sh/.bat for D2
     -  now experimental makette.xml for issuing build commands using makette.
